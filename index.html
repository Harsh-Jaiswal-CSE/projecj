		<p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development.[1] Education originated as transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly encompass new ideas such as liberation of learners, critical thinking about presented information, skills needed for the modern society, empathy and complex vocational skills.</p>

		<p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The current face of Education in the nation is actually turning out to be a major “silent hindrance” for India’s track to greater development. While all the attention is on social-political issues, it should quickly be turned on to educational reforms. Education has the power to all solve issues(wars, unemployment, waste management, corruption etc), in the long run, and a must for a developing country like India it cannot be ignored, not to say it is being ignored, India spends a lot of Education( somewhat only 2nd after defence), the results aren’t actually visible….
